Here are ten important highlights:\\n\\n1. Tax Revisions: The budget revised income tax slabs under the new tax regime, increasing the standard deduction for salaried employees from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Additionally, the deduction on family pension for pensioners was enhanced from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000.

Agriculture and Rural Development: The government allocated Rs 2.66 trillion for rural development, focusing on enhancing agricultural productivity and resilience. This includes transforming agriculture research, releasing new crop varieties, and promoting natural farming practices.\\n\\n3. Employment Generation: To boost employment, the Budget introduced measures such as providing one-month wages to new entrants in all formal sectors in three installments up to Rs 15,000, expected to benefit 21 million youth. Additionally, the government said it will reimburse EPFO contributions of employers up to Rs 3,000 per month for two years for all new hires, aiming to generate 5 million jobs.\\n\\n4.

Updated returns are filed by taxpayers who had omitted to report their correct income. Currently, such returns can be filed within two years of the relevant assessment year.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNearly 90 lakh taxpayers have voluntarily updated their incomes by paying additional tax.\\n\\nOver the past 10 years, our government has implemented several reforms for convenience of tax payers, such as faceless assessment, tax payers charter, faster returns, almost 99 per cent returns being on self-assessment, and Vivad se Vishwas scheme.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSitharaman in her Budget speech said the objectives of her taxation proposal are reforms in Personal Income Tax with special focus on middle class, rationalization of TDS/TCS for easing difficulties and voluntary compliance.\\n\\nThe Budget increased the threshold for tax deduction at source for better clarity and uniformity.\\n\\nIn the FY26 Budget, the limit for TDS deduction on interest for senior citizens has been doubled to Rs 1 lakh from the present Rs 50,000.\\n\\nSimilarly, the annual limit of Rs 2.40 lakh for TDS on rent is being increased to Rs 6 lakh. This will reduce the number of transactions liable to TDS, thus benefitting small tax payers receiving small payments, Sitharaman said.\\n\\nThe threshold to collect tax at source (TCS) on remittances under RBI's Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) too has been increased from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh.\\n\\nThe TCS on remittances for education purposes, where such remittance is out of a loan taken from a specified financial institution, has been exempted.\\n\\nThe Budget 2025-26 gave a relief to middle class with regard to tax incidence and rejigged slabs.\\n\\nSitharaman announced that annual income of up to Rs 12 lakh will be exempt from I-T under the new income tax regime. For salaried taxpayers, this income threshold will be Rs 12.75 lakh after taking into account standard deduction.\\n\\nAs per the rejig, for people earning more than Rs 12 lakh per annum, there will be nil tax for income up to Rs 4 lakh, 5 per cent for income between Rs 4 and 8 lakh, 10 per cent for Rs 8-12 lakh, and 15 per cent for Rs 12-16 lakh.\\n\\nA 20 per cent income tax will be levied on income between Rs 16 and 20 lakh, 25 per cent on Rs 20-24 lakh and 30 per cent above Rs 24 lakh per annum.\\n\\nA tax payer in the new regime with an income of Rs 12 lakh will get a benefit of Rs 80,000 in tax.
