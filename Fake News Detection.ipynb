Bihar finance minister Vijay Chaudhary displays a suitcase containing papers of the state budget 2022-23. (Santosh Kumar/HT photo)\\n\\nTabling the budget before the legislative assembly, finance minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary again raised the demand for special status for Bihar, while flagging concerns like a drop in grants in aid received from the Centre compared to the previous year, though Bihar\\u2019s share in central taxes has seen a rise.\\n\\nFocus has been laid on youth and employment, education, health and infrastructure, the minister said.\\n\\nAlso read: Bihar legislative council election, bypoll dates announced. Check here\\n\\n\\u201cWe have increased the budget outlay for 2023-24 by over 10% from \\u20b92.37 lakh last year. Our better fiscal management has helped in capping the fiscal deficit within the permissible limit of FRBM (fiscal responsibility budget management) act,\\u201d said Chaudhary, who tabled the \\u20b92,61,885.40 crore budget. \\u201cWe have estimated a revenue surplus budget.\\u201d\\n\\nThis was the first financial document of the seven-party Grand Alliance government led by chief minister Nitish Kumar after his Janata Dal (United) in August last year severed ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and joined hands with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Congress and Left parties.\\n\\nThe minister announced that the highest allocation of \\u20b940,450 crore has been made for education. An allocation of \\u20b916,966 crore has been made for health while the social welfare sector got \\u20b912,439 crore.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are working for generating 10 lakh jobs for the youth and the work is already in motion with requisition of 63,900 posts sent to BPSC (Bihar Public Service Commission) and Bihar staff selection board,\\u201d said Chaudhary. \\u201cWe are working for filling up 48,762 posts of teachers and there will be big vacancies in police and other sectors.\\u201d\\n\\nHe pointed out that the state\\u2019s fiscal deficit is pegged at 2.98% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) as against the permissible limit of 3% under the FRBM Act.\\n\\nChief minister Kumar said: \\u201cThis is a progressive budget. It would give impetus to high economic growth, better fiscal management and development of all sections of the society.\\n\\n\\u201cThe first budget of the Grand Alliance government is a status quo and center-dependent budget. An increase of only \\u20b92 crore for education is like peanuts,\\u201d BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said.\\n\\nChoudhary also raised the demand for special category status, saying Bihar requires it to tide over its backwardness despite having clocked a 10.98% economic growth in the current 2022-23 financial year.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need special status for faster economic progress as Bihar\\u2019s is plagued with certain geographical challenges and natural calamities like floods,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nThe minister said the grants in aid expected from the Union government for the year to March was estimated at \\u20b953,377.92 crore, which was \\u201c \\u20b94,623.37 crore less\\u201d than what was received in the previous fiscal. However, the budget also noted a slight increase in the state\\u2019s share in central taxes, which, at \\u20b91,02,737.26 crore for 2023-24, was \\u20b9376.12 crore more than the previous year.\\n\\nAlso read: Row over RJD leader's \\u2018army of eunuchs\\u2019 remark; \\u2018Nitish should at least\\u2026\\u2019: BJP\\n\\n\\u201cCentral devolutions is state\\u2019s own right.

Their wins are being attributed to the direct cash transfer schemes they launched just months before the elections. The ruling parties in both the states have returned with more seats than they held previously.\\n\\nTwo women-centric schemes paid off handsomely for the incumbents in each state - the Maharashtra Mahayuti's Mukhyamantri-Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana, providing Rs 1,500 a month to women; and the JMM-led government's Maiya Samman Yojana providing Rs 1,000 a month.\\n\\nThese elections also witnessed a large turnout of women voters. It can be concluded that cash transfer, in whatever name, is the gamechanger.\\n\\nIn Maharashtra, the Mahayuti has promised to increase the Ladki Bahin allowance from Rs 1,500 a month to Rs 2,100, and so has the JMM in Jharkhand - from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,500. This means more pressure on the states' treasury.\\n\\nSuccess of DBT\\n\\nIn October 2022, both the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank had praised India's DBT (direct benefit transfers) and how it had managed to transfer cash support to millions of people, benefiting especially the women, elderly and the farmers. Initially, it was just the Central government transferring money to the poor under its various schemes. But soon the states realised the benefit of DBT in electoral politics.\\n\\nThose in favour of DBT, especially state governments who introduced the schemes and reaped electoral benefits, say it provides the poor a greater variety of choices, increasing consumption unlike seen before.\\n\\nIn the 2021 West Bengal assembly election, Mamata Bannerjee dodged anti-incumbency and her party Trinamool Congress won with a bigger majority, mainly due to the 'Lakshmir Bhandar' scheme for women. The Congress came to power in Karnataka in May 2023 riding on its Gruha Lakshmi and Yuvanidhi schemes among many other promises, which was later adapted as the Mahalakshmi scheme for the Telangana election in December 2023, where too the Congress won.\\n\\nThe only aberration is Jagan Mohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh; his 'Jagananna Amma Vodi' launched in 2020 failed to ensure his win in the 2024 state election.\\n\\nThe BJP, which has always been strongly critical of what it calls the 'revadi' culture - comparing poll sops to a popular sweet - too has tasted election victory due to various DBT schemes for women and farmers, in Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and now in Maharashtra.\\n\\nIn the 2023 Madhya Pradesh election, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government's Ladli Behna scheme proved to be the reason for the BJP's stunning turnaround against all odds, including 20 years of anti-incumbency. The party even scored 54 more seats than its previous tally, leaving the Congress in shock.\\n\\n\\\"DBT significantly contributes to women's empowerment by increasing access to financial resources and giving women autonomy in household decision-making. It also enhances the social and economic status of women in the society,\\\" says Abhash Kumar, assistant professor of economics, Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, Delhi University.\\n\\nThe Election Commission says there has been a 5% surge in voters in Maharashtra, led by women. While 2,53,90,647 women voted in the 2019 assembly polls, 3,06,49,318 women voted on November 20 - an increase of 52,58,671 voters. In Jharkhand, women voters outnumbered the male in terms of voting percentage across 68 of the 81 assembly segments. Interestingly, women voters outnumbered the male voters by 5,51,797 across the state, according to election officials.\\n\\n\\\"The implementation of women-focused DBT schemes correlates with positive political outcomes for ruling parties in states. These women specific schemes have swayed women voters,\\\" Abhash Kumar explains.\\n\\nBurden versus benefit\\n\\nThe cash transfers have cost the state exchequer substantially.\\n\\nIt is estimated that in Maharashtra, the Rs 2,100 monthly to 'poor beneficiaries' will cost over Rs 5,000 crore a month. Other benefits, including the promise of higher pension by the ruling alliance, will likely add an annual burden of Rs 60,000 crore in Maharashtra.\\n\\nJharkhand's increased payout of Rs 2,500 to some 48 lakh women beneficiaries is likely to push up its outlay to Rs 14,400 crore. This, despite the state accruing huge benefits from tax on minerals due to a favourable Supreme Court verdict.\\n\\nThe latest electoral success of DBT, may result in political parties resorting to the magical wand in other states where elections are due. Political leaders will not hesitate to sacrifice long-term fiscal stability for short-term electoral gains. While the scheme offers financial relief, its execution may worsen states' precarious financial situation.\\n\\n\\\"When multiple schemes operate simultaneously the cumulative expenditure is huge and results in limiting funds for growth projects and infrastructure development,\\\" says Kumar.\\n\\n\\\"Moreover, there are challenges in identifying genuine beneficiaries, which leads to misallocations of resources. DBT also increases dependency on the government and reduces active labour participation in the market,\\\" he adds.\\n\\nReports say the BJP is planning to replicate its Maharashtra strategy in Delhi, where elections are due in February. A similar strategy has been AAP's poll plank since its debut in electoral politics. Women-focused initiatives are set to play a central role in BJP's electoral promises not just for Delhi but also in Bihar next year. The party is also planning to introduce a DBT scheme for women in its manifesto. Bihar is set to vote for a new government in November next year.\\n\\nThe increasing attention on women as a target voter group has shifted electoral dynamics in several states.

The new spending plan has replaced a stop-gap interim budget that came into effect from 1 April. The budget announcements clearly indicate a shift in priorities for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\u2019s new dispensation, with ramped up allocations for rural development, skilling, jobs and agriculture. Here are the six key takeaways from India\\u2019s budget:\\n\\nBad news for investors\\n\\nThe budget increased tax on long-term capital gains on all financial and non-financial assets to 12.5% from 10%. Assets held for over a year are considered long term. Short-term capital gains will now be taxed at 20% instead of 15%. The budget has also increased the securities transaction tax on derivatives trading. This was widely expected, with the Economic Survey released a day earlier raising red flags about rising speculation and growing participation of retail investors in Indian equity markets.\\n\\nGetty Images Job generation is a big challenge for the government\\n\\nA $24bn jobs plan\\n\\nMs Sitharaman has announced three new schemes to address India\\u2019s chronic employment challenge that will cost the government 2tn rupees ($24bn; \\u00a318.5bn) over the next five years. First-time job entrants in the formal sector will receive a direct cash transfer equivalent to their monthly salary (or up to a maximum of 15,000 rupees) in addition to their first month's pay. Additionally, two more programmes have been announced to boost manufacturing jobs through which the government will provide employment-linked incentives to both employees and employers.\\n\\nTax relief for start-ups, middle classes and foreign corporates\\n\\nThe country\\u2019s burgeoning start-up ecosystem will have something to cheer about, with an angel tax levied on capital raised by private companies now abolished. Minor tweaks were also announced to personal income taxes, with expected savings of up to 17,500 rupees ($209; \\u00a3162) in outgo for people who opt for the new tax regime. Corporate tax on foreign companies has also been reduced from 40% to 35% to promote investments.\\n\\nGetty Images Andhra Pradesh's capital Amaravati will get major financial support\\n\\nA budget for the allies\\n\\nThe budget sought to satisfy spending demands from the BJP's two key regional allies - Janata Dal (United) of the northern state of Bihar and Telugu Desam Party of southern Andhra Pradesh state - which hold 28 seats in India\\u2019s lower house. The finance minister announced financial support of 150bn rupees for the development of Andhra Pradesh\\u2019s capital, with a promise for more money in the coming years. A slew of new airport, road and power projects were sanctioned in Bihar.\\n\\nReduced budget deficit\\n\\nThe budget has set a new, reduced target for its fiscal deficit - the amount by which spending exceeds revenue - at 4.9% for this financial year, below the 5.1% announced earlier. The number is closely watched by ratings agencies and has a direct bearing on interest rates. A significant dividend payout of more than $25bn from the country\\u2019s central bank has enabled the government to reduce its deficit without cutting expenditure significantly.\\n\\nGetty Images Proposed capital expenditure on infrastructure creation hasn't been revised from the interim budget\\n\\nCapex unchanged\",\n",

The Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana will focus on improving agricultural productivity in 100 districts with low output, benefiting 1.7 crore farmers in India. The minister also announced a National Mission for Edible Oils and Seeds to drive self-reliance in the sector, while a six-year mission will work towards achieving Aatmanirbharta in pulses.

(Santosh Kumar/HT photo)\\n\\nTabling the budget before the legislative assembly, finance minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary again raised the demand for special status for Bihar, while flagging concerns like a drop in grants in aid received from the Centre compared to the previous year, though Bihar’s share in central taxes has seen a rise.\\n\\nFocus has been laid on youth and employment, education, health and infrastructure, the minister said.\\n\\nAlso read: Bihar legislative council election, bypoll dates announced.

Our better fiscal management has helped in capping the fiscal deficit within the permissible limit of FRBM (fiscal responsibility budget management) act,” said Chaudhary, who tabled the ₹2,61,885.40 crore budget. “We have estimated a revenue surplus budget.”\\n\\nThis was the first financial document of the seven-party Grand Alliance government led by chief minister Nitish Kumar after his Janata Dal (United) in August last year severed ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and joined hands with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Congress and Left parties.\\n\\nThe minister announced that the highest allocation of ₹40,450 crore has been made for education.

It would give impetus to high economic growth, better fiscal management and development of all sections of the society.\\n\\n“The first budget of the Grand Alliance government is a status quo and center-dependent budget. An increase of only ₹2 crore for education is like peanuts,” BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said.\\n\\nChoudhary also raised the demand for special category status, saying Bihar requires it to tide over its backwardness despite having clocked a 10.98% economic growth in the current 2022-23 financial year.\\n\\n“We need special status for faster economic progress as Bihar’s is plagued with certain geographical challenges and natural calamities like floods,” he added.\\n\\nThe minister said the grants in aid expected from the Union government for the year to March was estimated at ₹53,377.92 crore, which was “ ₹4,623.37 crore less” than what was received in the previous fiscal. However, the budget also noted a slight increase in the state’s share in central taxes, which, at ₹1,02,737.26 crore for 2023-24, was ₹376.12 crore more than the previous year.\\n\\nAlso read: Row over RJD leader's ‘army of eunuchs’ remark; ‘Nitish should at least…’: BJP\\n\\n“Central devolutions is state’s own right.

       " \"The Bihar government on Tuesday presented a ₹2.61 lakh crore budget for 2023-24, an increase of nearly 10% from last year, asserting that “better financial management” has helped in capping the state’s fiscal deficit within the permissible limit. Bihar finance minister Vijay Chaudhary displays a suitcase containing papers of the state budget 2022-23. (Santosh Kumar/HT photo)\\n\\nTabling the budget before the legislative assembly, finance minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary again raised the demand for special status for Bihar, while flagging concerns like a drop in grants in aid received from the Centre compared to the previous year, though Bihar’s share in central taxes has seen a rise.\\n\\nFocus has been laid on youth and employment, education, health and infrastructure, the minister said.\\n\\nAlso read: Bihar legislative council election, bypoll dates announced. Check here\\n\\n“We have increased the budget outlay for 2023-24 by over 10% from ₹2.37 lakh last year. Our better fiscal management has helped in capping the fiscal deficit within the permissible limit of FRBM (fiscal responsibility budget management) act,” said Chaudhary, who tabled the ₹2,61,885.40 crore budget. “We have estimated a revenue surplus budget.”\\n\\nThis was the first financial document of the seven-party Grand Alliance government led by chief minister Nitish Kumar after his Janata Dal (United) in August last year severed ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and joined hands with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Congress and Left parties.\\n\\nThe minister announced that the highest allocation of ₹40,450 crore has been made for education. An allocation of ₹16,966 crore has been made for health while the social welfare sector got ₹12,439 crore.\\n\\n“We are working for generating 10 lakh jobs for the youth and the work is already in motion with requisition of 63,900 posts sent to BPSC (Bihar Public Service Commission) and Bihar staff selection board,” said Chaudhary. “We are working for filling up 48,762 posts of teachers and there will be big vacancies in police and other sectors.”\\n\\nHe pointed out that the state’s fiscal deficit is pegged at 2.98% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) as against the permissible limit of 3% under the FRBM Act.\\n\\nChief minister Kumar said: “This is a progressive budget. It would give impetus to high economic growth, better fiscal management and development of all sections of the society.\\n\\n“The first budget of the Grand Alliance government is a status quo and center-dependent budget. An increase of only ₹2 crore for education is like peanuts,” BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said.\\n\\nChoudhary also raised the demand for special category status, saying Bihar requires it to tide over its backwardness despite having clocked a 10.98% economic growth in the current 2022-23 financial year.\\n\\n“We need special status for faster economic progress as Bihar’s is plagued with certain geographical challenges and natural calamities like floods,” he added.\\n\\nThe minister said the grants in aid expected from the Union government for the year to March was estimated at ₹53,377.92 crore, which was “ ₹4,623.37 crore less” than what was received in the previous fiscal. However, the budget also noted a slight increase in the state’s share in central taxes, which, at ₹1,02,737.26 crore for 2023-24, was ₹376.12 crore more than the previous year.\\n\\nAlso read: Row over RJD leader's ‘army of eunuchs’ remark; ‘Nitish should at least…’: BJP\\n\\n“Central devolutions is state’s own right. But Bihar is getting less in grants in aid,” the finance minister said.\\n\\nWhile no new schemes were announced in the budget, Choudhary said the government was focusing on “youth development, women empowerment and infrastructure development.”\\n\\nThe state government has made provision of ₹2,374 crore for the Mukhya Mantri Gram Sampark Yojana in 23-24, ₹800 crore for providing financial assistance for self-employment while ₹100 crore for Mukya Mantri Kanya Vivah Yojana and other schemes. The financial assistance for self-empowerment of divorced Muslim women has been increased from ₹10,000 to ₹25,000, the minister said.\",\n",
       " 'The Maharashtra and Jharkhand elections have seen the incumbent alliances retain power, defying anti-incumbency. Their wins are being attributed to the direct cash transfer schemes they launched just months before the elections. The ruling parties in both the states have returned with more seats than they held previously.\\n\\nTwo women-centric schemes paid off handsomely for the incumbents in each state - the Maharashtra Mahayuti\\'s Mukhyamantri-Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana, providing Rs 1,500 a month to women; and the JMM-led government\\'s Maiya Samman Yojana providing Rs 1,000 a month.\\n\\nThese elections also witnessed a large turnout of women voters. It can be concluded that cash transfer, in whatever name, is the gamechanger.\\n\\nIn Maharashtra, the Mahayuti has promised to increase the Ladki Bahin allowance from Rs 1,500 a month to Rs 2,100, and so has the JMM in Jharkhand - from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,500. This means more pressure on the states\\' treasury.\\n\\nSuccess of DBT\\n\\nIn October 2022, both the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank had praised India\\'s DBT (direct benefit transfers) and how it had managed to transfer cash support to millions of people, benefiting especially the women, elderly and the farmers. Initially, it was just the Central government transferring money to the poor under its various schemes. But soon the states realised the benefit of DBT in electoral politics.\\n\\nThose in favour of DBT, especially state governments who introduced the schemes and reaped electoral benefits, say it provides the poor a greater variety of choices, increasing consumption unlike seen before.\\n\\nIn the 2021 West Bengal assembly election, Mamata Bannerjee dodged anti-incumbency and her party Trinamool Congress won with a bigger majority, mainly due to the \\'Lakshmir Bhandar\\' scheme for women. The Congress came to power in Karnataka in May 2023 riding on its Gruha Lakshmi and Yuvanidhi schemes among many other promises, which was later adapted as the Mahalakshmi scheme for the Telangana election in December 2023, where too the Congress won.\\n\\nThe only aberration is Jagan Mohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh; his \\'Jagananna Amma Vodi\\' launched in 2020 failed to ensure his win in the 2024 state election.\\n\\nThe BJP, which has always been strongly critical of what it calls the \\'revadi\\' culture - comparing poll sops to a popular sweet - too has tasted election victory due to various DBT schemes for women and farmers, in Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and now in Maharashtra.\\n\\nIn the 2023 Madhya Pradesh election, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government\\'s Ladli Behna scheme proved to be the reason for the BJP\\'s stunning turnaround against all odds, including 20 years of anti-incumbency. The party even scored 54 more seats than its previous tally, leaving the Congress in shock.\\n\\n\"DBT significantly contributes to women\\'s empowerment by increasing access to financial resources and giving women autonomy in household decision-making. It also enhances the social and economic status of women in the society,\" says Abhash Kumar, assistant professor of economics, Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, Delhi University.\\n\\nThe Election Commission says there has been a 5% surge in voters in Maharashtra, led by women. While 2,53,90,647 women voted in the 2019 assembly polls, 3,06,49,318 women voted on November 20 - an increase of 52,58,671 voters. In Jharkhand, women voters outnumbered the male in terms of voting percentage across 68 of the 81 assembly segments. Interestingly, women voters outnumbered the male voters by 5,51,797 across the state, according to election officials.\\n\\n\"The implementation of women-focused DBT schemes correlates with positive political outcomes for ruling parties in states. These women specific schemes have swayed women voters,\" Abhash Kumar explains.\\n\\nBurden versus benefit\\n\\nThe cash transfers have cost the state exchequer substantially.\\n\\nIt is estimated that in Maharashtra, the Rs 2,100 monthly to \\'poor beneficiaries\\' will cost over Rs 5,000 crore a month. Other benefits, including the promise of higher pension by the ruling alliance, will likely add an annual burden of Rs 60,000 crore in Maharashtra.\\n\\nJharkhand\\'s increased payout of Rs 2,500 to some 48 lakh women beneficiaries is likely to push up its outlay to Rs 14,400 crore. This, despite the state accruing huge benefits from tax on minerals due to a favourable Supreme Court verdict.\\n\\nThe latest electoral success of DBT, may result in political parties resorting to the magical wand in other states where elections are due. Political leaders will not hesitate to sacrifice long-term fiscal stability for short-term electoral gains. While the scheme offers financial relief, its execution may worsen states\\' precarious financial situation.\\n\\n\"When multiple schemes operate simultaneously the cumulative expenditure is huge and results in limiting funds for growth projects and infrastructure development,\" says Kumar.\\n\\n\"Moreover, there are challenges in identifying genuine beneficiaries, which leads to misallocations of resources. DBT also increases dependency on the government and reduces active labour participation in the market,\" he adds.\\n\\nReports say the BJP is planning to replicate its Maharashtra strategy in Delhi, where elections are due in February. A similar strategy has been AAP\\'s poll plank since its debut in electoral politics. Women-focused initiatives are set to play a central role in BJP\\'s electoral promises not just for Delhi but also in Bihar next year. The party is also planning to introduce a DBT scheme for women in its manifesto. Bihar is set to vote for a new government in November next year.\\n\\nThe increasing attention on women as a target voter group has shifted electoral dynamics in several states. Sadly, good politics often sets the stage for bad economics.\\n\\n(The author is Contributing Editor, NDTV)\\n\\nDisclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author',\n",
