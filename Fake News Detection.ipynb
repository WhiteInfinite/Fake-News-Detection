Several scholarship and skill development schemes got major fund cuts including the merit-cum means scholarship for professional and technical courses for students from minority communities. The schemes have been allotted funds of \\u20b944 crore this year, while the Budget for the same was \\u20b9365 crore last year.\\n\\nThe Budget estimate for the Ministry of Minority Affairs was \\u20b95,020.50 crore in 2022-23. This time, the Ministry has been allotted \\u20b93,097 crore. To mention, the revised allocation of the funds to the Ministry in 2022-23 was \\u20b92,612.66 crore.\\n\\nAlso Read | Budget 2023 | Defence sector gets lion\\u2019s share\\n\\nThe Finance Ministry has also slashed the funds for the pre-metric scholarship for minorities for the financial year 2023-24 with over \\u20b9900 crore. The scholarship funds in the last Budget were \\u20b91,425 crore, which is reduced to \\u20b9433 crore this year.\\n\\nThe funds for post-metric scholarship, however, have been increased from \\u20b9515 crore to \\u20b91,065 crore.\\n\\nSchemes under the Ministry of Minority Affairs that provides support for students clearing Prelims conducted by UPSC, SSC, and State public service commission got nothing in the ongoing financial year. The Budget for the same was 8 crore last year. Similarly, the free coaching and allied schemes for minorities too saw a Budget cut of around 60% this year. The same was 79 crore last year, while 30 crore has been allocated for the same this year.\\n\\nThe total allocation of the Budget for education empowerment for minorities which was \\u20b92,515 crore last year is reduced to \\u20b91,689 crore this year.\\n\\nSkill development training like Nai Manzil, USTAD got a Budget of mere \\u20b910 lakh, the same was \\u20b9235 crore and \\u20b97 crore last year. The Budget for research schemes for minorities too has been slashed to \\u20b920 crore from \\u20b941 crore last year. The total funds for various skill development and livelihood schemes were \\u20b9491 crore in 2022-23 and the same is \\u20b964.40 crore this year.\\n\\nIn a massive fund cut, the Education Scheme for Madrasas and Minorities has been allocated \\u20b910 crore for the financial year 2023-24. The same is 93% less than the Budget allocation of 2022-23, which was \\u20b9160 crore.\\n\\nAlmost 50% cut is there in the special schemes for minorities which includes research, studies, publicity, monitoring and evaluation of development schemes for minorities, for conservation protection of the heritage of minorities and schemes for containing population decline of minorities.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a new addition, Prime Minister-Virasat ka samvardhan (PM Vikaas) has been added to the Ministry of Minority Affairs\\u2019 Budget this year. A total of \\u20b9540 crore has been allotted under the same.\\n\\nJawed A.

      "    \"content\": \"Chutneys, with their vibrant flavors, are a staple in many cuisines, especially Indian food. Whether you make them with fruits, vegetables, or herbs, chutneys can elevate any meal. However, one of the challenges of homemade chutneys is their shelf life. Unlike store-bought versions that contain preservatives, homemade chutneys are more prone to spoiling. But don\\u2019t worry! There are several simple methods to increase the shelf life of your homemade chutneys while preserving their fresh flavors. Here are 7 simple ways to improve the shelf life of your chutneys:1. Use Vinegar or Lemon Juice as a PreservativeAcidic ingredients like vinegar or lemon juice not only enhance the flavor of your chutney but also help in preserving it. The acidity lowers the pH of the chutney, making it an inhospitable environment for bacteria and mold. Adding a generous amount of vinegar (white vinegar or apple cider vinegar) or fresh lemon juice helps increase the shelf life. The acidity also prevents oxidation, keeping the chutney fresh for a longer time.2. Sterilize the ContainersProper storage is key to maintaining the freshness of chutneys. Before storing your chutney, sterilize the jars or containers you intend to use. This can be done by boiling the jars in water for 10-15 minutes or placing them in an oven at 160\\u00b0C (320\\u00b0F) for 10 minutes. Make sure the jars are completely dry before filling them with chutney. This prevents any bacteria from contaminating the chutney, which can reduce its shelf life.3. Use Salt and Sugar GenerouslySalt and sugar act as natural preservatives by drawing out moisture from the chutney and creating an environment where microbes are less likely to thrive. When making chutney, be sure to include the right balance of salt and sugar according to the recipe. Both ingredients will help prevent spoilage and enhance the flavor. However, avoid overusing them, as excessive salt or sugar may alter the taste.4. Cook the Chutney WellThe cooking process helps to reduce the water content in chutneys, which in turn increases their shelf life. Cooking the chutney on low heat for a sufficient amount of time ensures that it thickens and becomes less prone to bacterial growth. Be sure to cook the chutney until all the ingredients are well-blended and the mixture reaches a thick, jam-like consistency. This method also deepens the flavors of the chutney.5. Add Mustard Seeds or Fenugreek SeedsSpices like mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds not only add unique flavors to chutneys but also act as natural preservatives. Mustard seeds have antibacterial properties, while fenugreek seeds have antifungal benefits. Adding a pinch of these seeds while cooking or tempering the chutney helps extend its shelf life by preventing the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms.6. Use Oil for LayeringOne traditional method to preserve chutneys is by adding a layer of oil on top of the chutney after it's made. This oil acts as a barrier, preventing air from reaching the chutney, which reduces oxidation and the risk of mold growth. You can use mustard oil, olive oil, or any other oil suited for chutney, depending on the recipe. Just ensure the chutney is completely cooled before sealing the container and adding the oil layer.7. Refrigerate or Freeze for Long-Term StorageWhile most chutneys can last for about a week in the refrigerator, freezing them can extend their shelf life for several months. To freeze chutneys, simply transfer them to airtight containers or freezer bags, leaving a little room for expansion. When you\\u2019re ready to use them, allow the chutney to thaw in the fridge overnight before serving. This method is perfect for making large batches and enjoying chutney at any time of the year.Conclusion:With these 7 simple tips, you can significantly extend the shelf life of your homemade chutneys while preserving their fresh, tangy flavors. By using acidic ingredients like vinegar or lemon, sterilizing containers, incorporating natural preservatives like salt, sugar, and mustard seeds, and employing proper storage techniques, your chutneys will last longer and stay delicious. Now you can enjoy your homemade chutneys well beyond the kitchen and share them with family and friends!\",\n",

       "[\"This reduction impacts crucial programmes for housing, education, self-employment, and social security, raising serious concerns about the state's commitment to social justice and equity.\\n\\n‘Tribals continue to be marginalised’\\n\\nTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Close on the heels of halving nine scholarships for minority community students, the state govt has slashed funding for 27 out of 49 tribal welfare schemes , all in the name of its financial crisis. The state is home to 1.5 lakh tribal families and at least one-fourth of them depend on these programmes for housing, education, self-employment and social security.Many crucial initiatives were either dropped altogether or their funds drastically reduced in line with the govt decision to halve the Plan size, raising serious concerns about its commitment to social justice and equity .Despite claims of priority in the Plan cut implementation, the measures raise a critical question: Should marginalised populations, like tribals and minority students, bear the brunt of the financial crisis?With zero funds allocated this year, Gotra Valsalya Nidhi, providing insurance coverage for every tribal girl child at birth, is one major programme affected. Similarly, the Unnathi scheme - seeking to promote self-entrepreneurship among tribals - saw its funding cut completely. Tribal melas, vital for artisans to showcase their products, also lost substantial financial backing.Funds for “oorukkoottams”, the tribal assemblies that finalise welfare programmes, were reduced from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 1 crore, limiting their ability to function effectively. The laptops scheme for tribal students, which benefits 300 to 350 students annually, saw its funds trimmed from Rs 4.5 crore to Rs 2.5 crore, affecting their access to higher education and online resources.Among programmes that were scaled down, the food support programme for trib- al families, many of them fighting malnutrition, saw its funds reduced to Rs 20 crore from Rs 25 crore. Those for the resettlement of landless tribals were trimmed to Rs 22 crore from Rs 42 crore. The assistance for self-employment and skill development training was also reduced to Rs 5.1 crore from Rs 9 crore.The govt has claimed that the housing scheme for tribals under Life Mission remains untouched, with Rs 140 crore allocated this year, but only 25% of the overall allocation has been spent so far. If this trend continues, the earmarked funds may remain largely unutilised.The Valsalya Nidhi Insurance Scheme, aimed at improving the education and social status of scheduled caste girls, was dropped altogether. Several schemes for scheduled caste communities also faced reduction. The funds for the housing scheme for landless scheduled caste families were reduced to Rs 120 crore from Rs 300 crore, those for completing partially constructed houses to Rs 173.06 crore from Rs 222.06 crore and those for the marriage assistance scheme for scheduled caste women to Rs 50 lakh from Rs 86 lakh.The cut in tribal and scheduled caste welfare schemes, which represents a systematic withdrawal of support for the most vulnerable sections, has drawn sharp reactions. “Even after all these years of independence, tribal communities continue to be marginalised. They have not fully been integrated into the mainstream. It is not fair to cut schemes for them, regardless of the circumstances. What is needed is to find more funds,” said KS Rajendraprasad, president of Thambu, an NGO working for the upliftment of the tribal population.\",\n",

       " \"Chutneys, with their vibrant flavors, are a staple in many cuisines, especially Indian food. Whether you make them with fruits, vegetables, or herbs, chutneys can elevate any meal. However, one of the challenges of homemade chutneys is their shelf life. Unlike store-bought versions that contain preservatives, homemade chutneys are more prone to spoiling. But don’t worry! There are several simple methods to increase the shelf life of your homemade chutneys while preserving their fresh flavors. Here are 7 simple ways to improve the shelf life of your chutneys:1. Use Vinegar or Lemon Juice as a PreservativeAcidic ingredients like vinegar or lemon juice not only enhance the flavor of your chutney but also help in preserving it. The acidity lowers the pH of the chutney, making it an inhospitable environment for bacteria and mold. Adding a generous amount of vinegar (white vinegar or apple cider vinegar) or fresh lemon juice helps increase the shelf life. The acidity also prevents oxidation, keeping the chutney fresh for a longer time.2. Sterilize the ContainersProper storage is key to maintaining the freshness of chutneys. Before storing your chutney, sterilize the jars or containers you intend to use. This can be done by boiling the jars in water for 10-15 minutes or placing them in an oven at 160°C (320°F) for 10 minutes. Make sure the jars are completely dry before filling them with chutney. This prevents any bacteria from contaminating the chutney, which can reduce its shelf life.3. Use Salt and Sugar GenerouslySalt and sugar act as natural preservatives by drawing out moisture from the chutney and creating an environment where microbes are less likely to thrive. When making chutney, be sure to include the right balance of salt and sugar according to the recipe. Both ingredients will help prevent spoilage and enhance the flavor. However, avoid overusing them, as excessive salt or sugar may alter the taste.4. Cook the Chutney WellThe cooking process helps to reduce the water content in chutneys, which in turn increases their shelf life. Cooking the chutney on low heat for a sufficient amount of time ensures that it thickens and becomes less prone to bacterial growth. Be sure to cook the chutney until all the ingredients are well-blended and the mixture reaches a thick, jam-like consistency. This method also deepens the flavors of the chutney.5. Add Mustard Seeds or Fenugreek SeedsSpices like mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds not only add unique flavors to chutneys but also act as natural preservatives. Mustard seeds have antibacterial properties, while fenugreek seeds have antifungal benefits. Adding a pinch of these seeds while cooking or tempering the chutney helps extend its shelf life by preventing the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms.6. Use Oil for LayeringOne traditional method to preserve chutneys is by adding a layer of oil on top of the chutney after it's made.

You can use mustard oil, olive oil, or any other oil suited for chutney, depending on the recipe. Just ensure the chutney is completely cooled before sealing the container and adding the oil layer.7. Refrigerate or Freeze for Long-Term StorageWhile most chutneys can last for about a week in the refrigerator, freezing them can extend their shelf life for several months. To freeze chutneys, simply transfer them to airtight containers or freezer bags, leaving a little room for expansion. When you’re ready to use them, allow the chutney to thaw in the fridge overnight before serving. This method is perfect for making large batches and enjoying chutney at any time of the year.Conclusion:With these 7 simple tips, you can significantly extend the shelf life of your homemade chutneys while preserving their fresh, tangy flavors.
